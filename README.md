# The-Simon-Game

A good challenge which was given to me during The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.

When the game begins, you will have to copy the code with the colour which is shown. After this, the game will choose another random colour.
The user will then have to press on the first colour and the new colour. The game will add one colour after every round and the user will 
have to copy the sequence from the beginning.

This challenge was not a tutorial and although we were given tasks to break the project down, we were not given any code, as is probably evident with how messy it is. 
The css and HTML were provided as this was a challenge to learn Javascipt and Jqueiry.

If anyone has any input feel free to let me know.
